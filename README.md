This project involves predicting future WTI Crude Oil prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, a specialized type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) well-suited for time series forecasting. The historical WTI Crude Oil prices are loaded from a CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, where the data is sorted by date and normalized using MinMaxScaler to improve model performance. A helper function creates input-output pairs by considering a look-back period of 60 days to predict the next day's price. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets, with the input data reshaped into a 3D format for compatibility with the LSTM model. The LSTM model itself consists of three stacked LSTM layers with dropout regularization to prevent overfitting, followed by a Dense layer that outputs the predicted price. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss function, and training is done with early stopping to prevent overfitting. After training, the model's predictions on the test set are compared with actual prices, and performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The trained model is saved for future use
